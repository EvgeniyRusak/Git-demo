No matter what we face
We must face the moment of truth, baby

They say it's lonely at the top, in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
Nobody's invincible, no plan is foolproof
We all must meet our moment of truth

The same sheisty cats that you hang with, and do your thang with
Could set you up and wet you up, nigga, peep the language
It's universal, you play with fire it may hurt you
